QuickNail

QuickNail is a automatic gallery generator script. It is ideal for people with lots of digital camera pictures. It is small and easy to use. Just upload all your pictures to a directory and then upload the script. Thats it. And it is free.

No need to create thumbnails, or resize your images, or write any HTML. All you need is some web space. Here is an example gallery. Of course there are many options that can be set in the config file.

Quick installation

    * Download and unzip all archive contents into a folder
    * (for a minimal featureless installation, you only need to extract qnail.php)
    * Put jpg photos into that folder
    * Edit qconfig.ini to customize (optional)
    * Upload the whole directory to your web server
    * Visit qnail.php in a browser
