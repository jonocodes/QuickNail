Quick setup
-----------

  * Download and unzip all archive contents into a folder
  * (for a minimal featureless installation, you only need to extract qnail.php)
  * Put jpg photos into that folder
  * Edit qconfig.ini to customize (optional)
  * Upload the whole directory to your web server
  * Visit qnail.php in a browser
