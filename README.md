No need to create thumbnails, or resize your images, or write any HTML. All you need is some web space. There are many options that can be set in the config file if desired.

See the wiki for more details on [usage](https://github.com/jonocodes/QuickNail/wiki/Usage) and [development](https://github.com/jonocodes/QuickNail/wiki/Development).

## Quick setup ##

  * Download and unzip all archive contents into a folder
  * (for a minimal featureless installation, you only need to extract qnail.php)
  * Put jpg photos into that folder
  * Edit qconfig.ini to customize (optional)
  * Upload the whole directory to your web server
  * Visit qnail.php in a browser

## Server Side Requirements ##

PHP 4.3.x and GD graphics library (most installations have this already)
